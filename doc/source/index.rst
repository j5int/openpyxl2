Introduction
------------

OpenPyxl is a Python library to read/write Excel 2007 xlsx/xlsm files.

It was born from lack of existing library to read/write natively from Python
the new Office Open XML format.

All kudos to the PHPExcel team as openpyxl is a Python port of PHPExcel http://www.phpexcel.net/

How to Contribute Code
----------------------

Any help will be greatly appreciated, just follow those steps:

    1. Please start a new fork
    (https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl/fork) for each independent
    feature, don't try to fix all problems at the same time, it's easier for
    those who will review and merge your changes ;-)

    2.
    Hack hack hack

    3. Don't forget to add unit tests for your changes ! (YES, even if it's a
    one-liner, or there is a high probability your work will not be taken
    into consideration). There are plenty of examples in the /test directory
    if you lack know-how or inspiration.

    4. If you added a whole new feature, or just improved something, you can
    be proud of it, so add yourself to the AUTHORS file :-)

    5.
    Let people know about the shiny thing you just implemented, update the docs !

    6. When it's done, just issue a pull request (click on the large "pull
    request" button on *your* repository) and wait for your code to be
    reviewed, and, if you followed all theses steps, merged into the main
    repository.

.. note:

This is an open-source project, maintained by volunteers on their spare time,
so while we try to work on this project as often as possible, sometimes life
gets in the way. Please be patient.

Other ways to help
------------------

There are several ways to contribute, even if you can't code (or can't code well):

    - triaging bugs on the bug tracker: closing bugs that have already been
      closed, are not relevant, cannot be reproduced, ...

    - updating documentation in virtually every area: many large features have
      been added (mainly about charts and images at the moment) but without any
      documentation, it's pretty hard to do anything with it

    - proposing compatibility fixes for different versions of Python: we support
      2.6 to 3.3, so if it does not work on your environment, let us know :-)


Installation
------------

The best method to install openpyxl is using a PyPi client such as
easy_install (setuptools) or pip. It is advisable to do this in a Python
virtualenv without system packages::

    $ pip install openpyxl

or ::

    $ easy_install openpyxl

.. note::

    To install from sources (there is nothing to build, openpyxl is 100% pure
    Python), you can download an archive from `bitbucket`_ (look in the
    "tags" tab).

    There is support for the popular `lxml`_ library which will be used if it is installed.

    After extracting the archive, you can do::

    $ python setup.py install

.. _bitbucket: https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl/downloads
.. _lxml: http://lxml.de

.. warning::

    To be able to include images (jpeg,png,bmp,...) into an openpyxl file,
    you will also need the 'PIL' library that can be installed with::

    $ pip install pillow

    or browse https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow/, pick the latest version
    and head to the bottom of the page for Windows binaries.


Getting the source
------------------

Source code is hosted on bitbucket.org. You can get it using a Mercurial client and the following URLs:

    * $ hg clone \https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl -r |release|

or to get the latest development version:

    * $ hg clone \https://bitbucket.org/ericgazoni/openpyxl
