Creating a chart
----------------

Charts are composed of at least one series of one or more data points. Series
themselves are comprised of references to cell ranges.

>>> from openpyxl import Workbook
>>> wb = Workbook()
>>> ws = wb.active
>>> for i in range(10):
>>>     ws.append(i)
>>>
>>> from openpyxl.charts import BarChart, Reference, Series
>>> values = Reference(ws, (1, 1), (10, 1))
>>> series = Series(values, title="First series of values")
>>> chart = BarChart()
>>> chart.append(series)
>>> ws.add_chart()
>>> wb.save("SampleChart.xlsx")
